<h2>Languages: DNH (C-Like Scripting Language)</h2>
<h1>About</h1>
One of the many projects I have made within the engine <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Danmakufu">Danmakufu</a>. 

<h1>Brief Engine Background Knowledge</h1>
Due to how niche this engine is, a brief explaination of the engine is probably needed. In short, Danmakufu is a 2D engine designed specifically for the creation of bullet hells. It's optimised to handle a large amount of projectiles on screen and was initially created for japanese fans of the 'Touhou' series to make their own inspired games. Everything is coded in the scripting language 'DNH', which resembles C. By default, the engine comes with the basics of a game engine (sprite rendering, sound ect.) but in comparison to more well known engines, it's increadibly lacking. Despite all this, it is still the main choice of engine when it comes to making Touhou-inspired games due to many of the most popular fangames using this engine.
