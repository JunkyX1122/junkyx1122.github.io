<h1>About</h1>
This module required me to create a small game in C++ using an engine build I had to build mostly from scratch. The game I ended up making was a third-person multiplayer game where players run around collecting crystals and bring them back to home base, whilst avoiding other players and the enemies within the level. I was required to implement the physics, enemy AI and a form of networking using the knowledge we gained from lectures and tutorials. Using the turoials I was able to set up:
<li>Collision: Detection and resolution between rays, AABB cubes and spheres.
<li>AI: State machines and finding algorithms.
<li>Networking: Basic server-client text communication.
</li>
<br>
We were also given same base graphics library provided in the previous model. A lot of elements that were crucial in making a propper engine were left out.<br>
