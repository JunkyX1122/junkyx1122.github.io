Goo Surge was a game made for the Pirate Software Game Jam, with the central theme of the games being the phrase 'It's Spreading'. The game involves the player traversing a map, searching for the goo containers in order to break the substance out and cause destruction. Myself and three other teammates spend 2 weeks of our winter break putting together a game with a technically impressive central mechanic, that being the spreading and control over the goo. We managed to release the game with a full gameplay loop whilst maintaining a framerate above 60fps, with the only major critisism of the game being the lack of context cues/tutorial that helped instruct the player on what to do.<br><br>
My main contributions to the game were:
<li>Constructing the main player and their main functionalities.
<li>Ensuring that said player felt satisfying to control.
<li>Building the main tool needed make the enviroment.
<li>Some art used inside and out of the game.<br><br>
