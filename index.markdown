C++ Games Programmer. Graduating MComp (Game Engineering) Student of Newcastle University.<br>
Programming games since 2015.</h2></center>
<br>
I'm Erick, a student at Newcastle University who is set to graduate the MComp Game Engineering course by July 2024. I have a passion for visual flare, game-feel and made my start
in games programming through making bullet hells in a niche engine. I am currently focusing on learning C++ and have already made a few projects within the language. I'm 
hoping to get a job within the games industry and make a start to my game engineering and development career.
<br><br>
This website is dedicated to showing off various projects I have worked on in and outside of education. Below are some images showing off the types of projects I have done. For information on individual projects, you can click on the <a href="/Portfolio">Portfolio</a> tab at the top of the page, or click on the images below.
